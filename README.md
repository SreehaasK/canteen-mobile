# canteen-mobile
The aim of this project is to reduce waiting times and enhance the overall student experience in the canteen. The proposed project allows students to order their meals in advance using a android application, which they can access from their smartphones. The system also includes features such as real-time order tracking and payment options. The findings suggest that the pre-food ordering system is highly beneficial for both the students and the canteen operators. It reduces waiting times, improves the accuracy of orders, and increases customer satisfaction. Overall, we can conclude that the proposed project is a promising solution to the challenges faced by college canteens and recommends its implementation in college canteens.
